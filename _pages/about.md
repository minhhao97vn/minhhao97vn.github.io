Hi, my name is Minh-Hao Van (Văn Minh Hào in Vietnamese). I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Arkansas, advised by [Prof. Xintao Wu](http://www.csce.uark.edu/~xintaowu/). My research interests include Machine Learning and Deep Learning, with a specific emphasis on exploring and improving the trustworthiness in AI/ML models. Please see my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ogpWyScyzC68uSWqHRgDeMdwsF7s7tsI/view?usp=sharing) here.

Prior to University of Arkansas, I earned my B.Eng degree in Computer Science with Honors from HCMC University of Technoloty (Bach Khoa University), VNUHCM, in 2019. During my undergraduate study, I used to work on Machine Learning method for predicting the cryptocurrency price movements and the impact of social media news on the price with [Dr. Khuong Nguyen-An](https://blog.efiens.com/author/nguyen-an-khuong/). 

Feel free to contact me via [email](haovan@uark.edu) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haovan97/) if you are interested in my research. I am also willing to have a coffee chat when you drop by North-West Arkansas area.
