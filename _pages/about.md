Hi, my name is Minh-Hao Van (Văn Minh Hào in Vietnamese), and I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Arkansas. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Arkansas, advised by [Prof. Xintao Wu](http://www.csce.uark.edu/~xintaowu/). My research interests include Machine Learning and Deep Learning, with a specific emphasis on exploring and improving the trustworthiness in AI/ML models. Recently, my work has centered on addressing robustness, safety, privacy, and fairness challenges in Large (Vision) Language Model. I also explore resource-efficient approaches for adapting large models to novel tasks, as well as the development of AI foundation models for scientific domains such as biomedical engineering and materials science. Please see my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uwMF1G55wFk8U71mct__bphR9qXXWxQW/view?usp=sharing) here.

Prior to University of Arkansas, I earned my B.Eng degree in Computer Science with Honors from HCMC University of Technoloty (Bach Khoa University), VNUHCM, in 2019. During my undergraduate study, I used to work on Machine Learning method for predicting the cryptocurrency price movements and the impact of social media news on the price with [Dr. Khuong Nguyen-An](https://blog.efiens.com/author/nguyen-an-khuong/). 

Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:haovan@uark.edu) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haovan97/) if you are interested in my research. I am also willing to have a coffee chat when you drop by North-West Arkansas area.
